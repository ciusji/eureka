# Changelog

## Version 1.0.0
* Flags `--clear-editor` and `--clear-repo` now actually works
* The dependency `serde` has been removed. I think it deserves a new release.
* Remove usage of numbers in selecting your editor which caused confusion.
* After first time setup - do not prompt user for idea.
